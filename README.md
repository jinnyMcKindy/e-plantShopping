# React Shopping Cart App

## Project Overview

This project is a **React Shopping Cart App** that serves as the final project for the last module of your course. You will be evaluated on this project through a peer review process, where you will also evaluate one of your peer's projects based on a rubric with objective grading criteria.

## Key Features

- **Functional Components**: Utilize React's functional components to build the app.
- **State Management**: Implement state management using Redux. You'll work with actions, reducers, and the store to manage application states effectively.
- **Component Nesting**: Leverage the project architecture to compose components using a nesting structure for better organization and maintainability.
- **Side Effects Management**: Use the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects within your application.
- **Event Handling**: Handle user events to render fetched data from an array and trigger corresponding actions.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will apply and integrate many skills learned in the instructional modules, including:

- Creating and updating functional components using states and hooks.
- Managing state with Redux.
- Composing components in a nested structure.
- Managing side effects with `useEffect`.
- Handling user interactions to fetch and display data dynamically.

## Practice Project

This module includes a practice project designed to assist you in developing the required components and functionality for the final project. Utilize this practice opportunity to refine your skills and prepare for the successful completion of your shopping cart app.
